    <p>Hi guys, hope your well. What I want to tell you today is more about perspective than technique. Letâ€™s get straight to the point. We call our site vulnerable.com. I was aiming to find interesting directories to access admin on vulnerable site. I used ffuf for this and accessed a directory called cms. But I got 403 forbidden.</p>
